** Prunch-up Description: **
Create a section in my  gallery page that's interactive and fun at the bottom of the page. The idea is to create a fun little interactive element for my portfolio. The element responds to mouse movement and key inputs. It would be a drop and catch type of game, where my avatar will be catching certain objects of interest.




** How it will enhance my work: **
This punch-up will add a fun and engaging section to my portfolio, making it both memorable, and engaging. It will help demonstrate my ability to mix design and vector graphics with frontend coding, beyond the simple interactions, hover states, and layouts I have been implementing so far. This will help showcase how although I am design heavy, I have other skills that could be beneficial and useful, as I am multi-faceted.

** Fears, uncertainties, doubts about the implementation: **
- Coding: The biggest concern I have right now is about my ability to execute and code this idea out. Coding isn't my strongest skill, so I'm not sure how long or how difficult this may be for me. 

- Time: Another concern I have is the amount of time I have, especially with the pressure of getting our portfolios done on time. I feel a little rushed and unsure if there's time to implement what I want.
